# oeg-software-graph
[![Project Status: Concept â€“ Minimal or no implementation has been done yet, or the repository is only intended to be a limited example, demo, or proof-of-concept.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/concept.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#concept)

## Description

This repository contain the resources to build a knowledge graph containing the catalog of software from the oeg-upm organization in GitHub. The source data is generated with the SOftware Metadata Extraction Framework ([SOMEF](https://github.com/KnowledgeCaptureAndDiscovery/somef)), which extracts the relevant information of a repository from README files and saves it as JSON files. Then, a knowledge graph that relies on the Software Description Ontology ([SDO](https://w3id.org/okn/o/sd)) is created using [RML-star](http://w3id.org/rml/star/spec/) mappings. The resulting knowledge graph is then queried to assess the adoption of a set of representative best practices for research software publishing.

## Structure

This repository is organized as follows:
* `data/` contains the input JSON file aggregating the metadata extracted of all repositories from the oeg-upm GitHub organisation (`somef.json`), along with the produced knowledge graph (`somef-kg.nq`)
* `mappings/` contains the RML-star mappings needed to construct the knowledge graph from the JSON file
* `notebooks/` contains two notebooks, for i) the generation of the JSON files and ii) construction and querying of the knowledge graph
* `best-practices-requirements/` describes the set of representative best practices that are assessed in the repositories represented in the knowledge graph

## Installation
This pipeline has been tested in `Python 3.9`.

In order to run the pipeline, you need to install [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/install):

```
pip install notebook
```

Then, install the requirements of the project. Creating an environment is highly recommended: 

```
pip install -e requirements.txt
```

Finally, start Jupyter notebook and run the notebooks in the `notebooks` folder. 

### Requirements: 

Our pipeline makes use of the `somef`, `yatter`, `morph-kgc` and `pyoxigraph` packages. For more information about the versions used, see the [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) file.
