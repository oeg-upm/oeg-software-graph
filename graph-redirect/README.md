# oeg-software-graph - redirection.

If you arrived here, you may have been redirected from one of the URIs we use in our Knowledge Graph.

As this repository is a concept/demo, we are currently not hosting the Knowledge Graph online. However, you can still try the SPARQL queries yourself by following the instructions in our main [README](https://github.com/oeg-upm/oeg-software-graph#installation). 

If you have already installed the required libraries, you can jump right into the queries in the [following notebook](https://github.com/oeg-upm/oeg-software-graph/blob/main/notebooks/kg-construction.ipynb).
