# Queries

Based on available guidelines for FAIR research software ([1],[2]), these queries aim to quantify the best practices followed by a given repository. Note that the SPARQL queries quantify the overall results in all processed repositories:

1. Description: Are there any descriptions in the repository? Are they short descriptions or longer descriptions included in the readme?
2. Registry/ Unique identifier: Is the software component archived in Zenodo? Does it have a Digital Object Identifier?
3. Are there available releases to download the repository?
4. Is there any versioning scheme followed?
5. Is there any documentation available, such as installation or run instructions?
6. Does the repository have a license?
7. Does the repository indicate how to cite its contents? 
8. Does the repository include basec metadata including programming language, description, creation date, keywords and releases?
9. Does the repository provide installation instructions?
10. Are there any requirements specified anywhere?

## Additional queries:
11. When was the metadata from a repository extracted last?
12. Which is the method most commonly used for citation? A CFF file, a CITATION file or some notes in the readme file?
